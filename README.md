🏗️ Eaglercraft 1.14.4 - Java Port
-
This is a 1.8.8 client with 1.13 and 1.14 features added. This client is written in Java and ported to JS using the shell file on linux/codespace. All assets and AI are ripped from the real game. Will be merged with 1.12.2 (hopefully)

**Note**: The new blocks and items on this client will probably not work on a real Minecraft 1.13+ server that is not eaglercraft only because the ids are no longer numerical after the great flattening in 1.13. So stick with eaglercraft for now!

**Features**: Looms, barrels, sweet Berries, new title screen, stripped logs, bamboo, new textures and skins.

**Play**: https://pizzaworkspace2.github.io/Minecraft-1.14.4
